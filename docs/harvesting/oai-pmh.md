The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a well estabilished specification to provide a machine accionable harvest endpoint for a respository. If DataCite is used to register DOI:s each prefix will be harvestable in thier central endpoint witch will make it harvestable by SND and other repostitories.
This is the recomended way to provide metadata to SND:s metadata catalogue.
